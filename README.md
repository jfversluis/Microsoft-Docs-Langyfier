# Microsoft Docs Langyfier

When navigating to docs.microsoft.com, the page might be translated into your native language, even through automated translations. I, however, like to just review the docs in English. There is no way to force this through Microsoft Docs right now. That is why I created this plugin.

Simply choose a language that you do not want to see and a language that you _do_ want to see.
Whenever you reach the Docs in the unwanted language, it will automaticall switch to your
preferred language.
